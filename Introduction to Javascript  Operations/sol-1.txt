Operators in JavaScript are fundamental elements that allow developers to perform various operations on data. They facilitate mathematical computations, logical evaluations, and assignments, playing a crucial role in expressing the functionality of a program. By using operators, programmers can efficiently manipulate variables, compare values, and control the flow of their code. Whether it's adding numbers, checking conditions, or concatenating strings, operators are indispensable tools that contribute to the flexibility and expressiveness of JavaScript programs.
