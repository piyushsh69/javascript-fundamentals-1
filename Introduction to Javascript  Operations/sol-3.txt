1). Unary Operators:
    Definition: Unary operators are operators that work with a single operand.

    Example -
        let num = 5;

        // Unary Negation (changes the sign)
        let negatedNum = -num;  // negatedNum is now -5

        // Increment (pre-increment)
        let incrementedNum = ++num;  // num is now 6, incrementedNum is 6

        // Decrement (post-decrement)
        let decrementedNum = num--;  // num is now 5, decrementedNum is 6

2). Binary Operators:
    Definition: Binary operators are operators that work with two operands.

    Example -
        let a = 10;
        let b = 5;

        // Addition
        let sum = a + b;  // sum is 15

        // Multiplication
        let product = a * b;  // product is 50

        // Logical AND
        let result = (a > 5) && (b < 10);  // result is true

3). Ternary Operator:
    Definition: The ternary operator is a shorthand way of writing an if-else statement. It works with three operands.

    Syntax - condition ? expr1 : expr2;

    Example -
        let age = 20;

        // Ternary operator to determine status
        let status = (age >= 18) ? "Adult" : "Minor";

    In the ternary operator example, if the condition (age >= 18) is true, the value of status will be "Adult"; otherwise, it will be "Minor."
