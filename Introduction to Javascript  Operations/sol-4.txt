Operator Precedence and Associativity are two concepts that dictate the order in which operators are evaluated in a complex expression. These concepts are crucial for understanding how expressions are parsed and executed in JavaScript.

Operator Precedence -

    Definition -
        Operator precedence determines the order in which operators are evaluated when multiple operators are present in an expression. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated first.

    Importance -
        Understanding operator precedence is vital to avoiding unexpected results in expressions and ensuring that expressions are evaluated as intended.

    Example -
        let result = 2 + 3 * 4;
        In this example, multiplication has a higher precedence than addition, so 3 * 4 is evaluated first, and then the result is added to 2.

Associativity -

    Definition -
        Associativity determines the order of evaluation for operators with the same precedence. It can be either left-to-right or right-to-left.

    Importance -
        Associativity is crucial when multiple operators of the same precedence are present in an expression. It clarifies the order in which operations are performed.

    Example -
        let result = 10 - 5 - 2;
        In this example, the subtraction operator is left-associative, so the leftmost operation 10 - 5 is evaluated first, and then the result is subtracted from 2.
