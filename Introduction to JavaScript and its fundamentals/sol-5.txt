Comments in JavaScript are essential for improving code readability, explaining functionality, and making it easier for developers (including yourself or others) to understand the purpose and logic behind different parts of the code. Comments are ignored by the JavaScript interpreter and do not affect the execution of the code.

Importance of Comments -

    - Code Explanation
    - Documentation
    - Debugging
    - Collaboration

Example -

    // This is a single-line comment
    let firstName = "Piyush";  // Variable storing the first name

    /*
    This is a multi-line comment.
    let firstName = "Piyush";
    */
