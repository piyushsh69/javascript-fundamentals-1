Variables are used to store and manage data in a program. They provide a way to reference and manipulate values, making code more flexible and dynamic. The purpose of declaring variables is to reserve a memory location to store a value and to assign a name (identifier) to that location. This enables developers to refer to and modify the stored value throughout the program.

Example -
    Declaration and initialization -
        let age; // Variable declaration without initialization
         or
        let age = 22; // Variable declaration with initialization

    Reassignment -
        let age = 22;
        age = age + 1;
